            <h3>Gesture Glove</h3>
            <p>Glove designed to take hand motion and use it as an input device
            for a computer. The physical structure is made from a combination
            of 3D printed parts and silicone molded parts. It uses linear 
            potentiometers to determine the position of each finger and then 
            maps this to keystrokes.</p>
